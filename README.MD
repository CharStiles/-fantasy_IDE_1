# Fantasy IDE ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

These are a series of experiments with reimagining the creative coding IDE.
This verion has bi-directional programming, with a javascript represention and a visual graphical representation. It has an AI tile that can augment the code as well as critique it. Other graphical integrations are webGL, webGPU and windowing/webcam input

font in the IDE is by Clara Sambot from https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/cirruscumulus/

## Updates ðŸŽª

You can read more about roadmap and updates at [charstiles.github.io/loading/](https://charstiles.github.io/loading/)

cd -fantasy_IDE_1
```

2. Install :
```bash
npm install
```

3. (optional to use AI components) Create your `.env` file :
```
API_KEY=your_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

4. Start:

## Features ðŸš€

### Shader Diff System
- **Automatic Diff Saving**: Every successful shader compilation is automatically saved as a diff
- **Diff Visualization**: Click the "ðŸ“Š Diff History" button to view a tree of all shader changes
- **AI Summaries**: Each diff includes an AI-generated summary of what changed (requires OpenAI API key)
- **Load Previous Versions**: Click any diff to load that version of the shader back into the editor
- **Cleanup**: Diffs are automatically minimized when shaders are minimized

### How to Use the Diff System
1. Create or edit a WebGL/WebGPU node
2. Make changes to your shader code
3. When the shader compiles successfully, a diff is automatically saved
4. Click the "ðŸ“Š Diff History" button in the toolbar to view all diffs
5. Click on any diff to see details and load that version
6. Use the Load/Delete buttons to manage your shader history
